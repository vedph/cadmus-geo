# Asserted Locations

A set of locations each having an optional assertion.

Each location has at least a reference point (latitude and longitude); it can add a bounding box, defined by two corner points linked by the box's diagonal; and an optional geometry used to represent the region covered by this location (see e.g. <http://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/geometries.html>).

Additionally, each location can have an assertion (from [Cadmus bricks](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks)) representing its certainty level and documentary references.
